🎮 Mini JavaScript Games Collection
Welcome to a small but mighty collection of classic browser-based games built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
This project is a fun showcase of simple logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI — perfect for beginners exploring web dev or anyone wanting quick casual games.

🚗 Included Games

1. Car Animation Game
   A simple animation demo where clicking Start moves a car across the screen, and Stop pauses it.
   Great for understanding timeouts and basic element positioning.

2. Number Guessing Game
   Try to guess the randomly generated number!
   The app gives hints (above/below) and keeps track of how many guesses you’ve made.

3. Rock Paper Scissors
   The classic showdown between you and the computer.
   Includes real-time results and score tracking for both sides.

🖼️ Slideshow Menu
The index.html file displays a slideshow-based home screen where users can browse all the games using Next and Previous buttons.
Clicking an image opens the selected game.
Slideshow transitions + logic are handled in script.js.
